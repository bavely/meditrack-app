# User Guide: Scanning Cylindrical Medication Bottles

## Overview

MediTrack's advanced scanning system is specifically designed to read labels on cylindrical medication bottles. This guide will help you get the best results when scanning your prescriptions.

## How It Works

### The Technology
- **Video Recording**: The app records a 6-second video as you move around the bottle
- **3D Unwrapping**: Our backend service flattens the curved label into a readable image  
- **AI Text Recognition**: Advanced OCR and AI extract medication information
- **Smart Parsing**: AI identifies drug names, dosages, and instructions automatically

### Why Video Instead of Photos?
Cylindrical bottles present unique challenges:
- Labels wrap around the curved surface
- Important information may be on multiple sides
- Single photos miss critical details
- Video capture ensures complete coverage

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Environment
- **Lighting**: Find a well-lit area (natural light is best)
- **Space**: Ensure you have room to move around the bottle
- **Surface**: Place bottle on a stable, contrasting surface
- **Cleanliness**: Wipe the label clean of any dust or residue

### 2. Position the Bottle
- Hold the bottle **vertically** (upright)
- Position it **6-8 inches** from your camera
- Center the bottle in your camera view
- Ensure the label is clearly visible

### 3. Start Recording
- Tap the **record button** (play icon)
- The app will begin a **6-second countdown**
- You'll hear voice prompts at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%

### 4. Perform the Rotation
- **Keep the bottle stationary** in your non-camera hand
- **Move yourself and the camera** around the bottle
- Complete a **full 360-degree rotation** over 6 seconds
- Maintain **steady, smooth movement**
- Keep the **same distance** throughout

### 5. Processing
- The app uploads your video for processing
- Backend systems unwrap the cylindrical label
- OCR extracts text from the flattened image
- AI parses the medication information
- Review and confirm the results

## Visual Guidance Features

### On-Screen Indicators
- **Bottle Outline**: Shows optimal positioning
- **Rotation Path**: Indicates your movement path
- **Progress Ring**: Shows recording progress
- **Quality Feedback**: Real-time status updates

### Status Colors
- üü¢ **Green**: Excellent conditions, ready to scan
- üü° **Yellow**: Good conditions, minor adjustments needed
- üü† **Orange**: Poor conditions, improvements recommended
- üî¥ **Red**: Error conditions, repositioning required

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Move slowly and steadily
- Keep bottle vertical and stable
- Maintain consistent distance
- Ensure good lighting on all sides
- Complete the full 360¬∞ rotation
- Hold your phone steadily

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Rush the rotation movement
- Tilt or rotate the bottle itself
- Block the label with your fingers
- Record in poor lighting conditions
- Stop moving before recording ends
- Get too close or too far from bottle

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "No bottle detected"
- **Solution**: Improve lighting and center the bottle
- **Check**: Bottle is vertical and clearly visible
- **Try**: Moving to a better-lit location

#### "Move camera closer/farther"
- **Solution**: Adjust your distance to 6-8 inches
- **Check**: Bottle fills about 40-60% of screen height
- **Try**: Using the on-screen distance guides

#### "Improve lighting conditions"
- **Solution**: Move to brighter area or turn on flash
- **Check**: No harsh shadows on the label
- **Try**: Positioning near a window (avoiding glare)

#### "Poor scanning quality"
- **Solution**: Slow down your rotation movement
- **Check**: Moving smoothly around the bottle
- **Try**: Practicing the rotation motion first

#### "Processing failed"
- **Solution**: Try scanning again with better conditions
- **Check**: Internet connection is stable
- **Try**: Manual entry as backup option

### Label-Specific Tips

#### Small Text Labels
- Get slightly closer (5-6 inches)
- Ensure maximum lighting
- Rotate more slowly for better frame capture

#### Reflective Labels
- Adjust lighting angle to reduce glare
- Turn off flash if it creates reflections
- Try positioning at a slight angle

#### Partially Damaged Labels
- Focus on the clearest sections
- Consider multiple scan attempts
- Use manual entry for missing information

#### Multi-Section Labels
- Ensure you capture the entire height
- Pay attention to top and bottom sections
- Complete rotation may reveal additional text

## Quality Indicators

### During Recording
- **Frame Rate**: Maintains smooth video capture
- **Rotation Coverage**: Tracks your movement progress  
- **Quality Score**: Real-time assessment of scan quality
- **Consistency**: Monitors steady movement patterns

### Success Factors
- **Coverage**: Complete 360¬∞ rotation achieved
- **Clarity**: Sharp, well-lit label visibility
- **Stability**: Minimal camera shake or bottle movement
- **Completeness**: All label sections captured
