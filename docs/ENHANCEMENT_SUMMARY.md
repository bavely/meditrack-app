### Enhanced Scanning Flow
```typescript
// With new guidance overlay
<CylindricalGuidanceOverlay
  isRecording={isRecording}
  rotationProgress={rotationProgress}
  colorScheme={colorScheme}
/>

// With real-time feedback
const feedback = generateScanningFeedback(
  bottleDetection, 
  scanningMetrics, 
  isRecording
);
```

### Alternative Scanning
```typescript
// Automatic fallback scanning
const scanner = new AlternativeScanningManager();
const result = await scanner.performAlternativeScan('auto');

// Manual method selection
const photoResult = await scanner.performAlternativeScan('photo_stitching');
const singleResult = await scanner.performAlternativeScan('single_photo');
const guidedResult = await scanner.performAlternativeScan('manual_guide');
```

### Bottle Detection
```typescript
// Real-time bottle analysis
const detection = await analyzeFrameForBottle(frameUri, width, height);
const feedback = generateScanningFeedback(detection, metrics, isRecording);

// Rotation tracking
const tracker = new RotationTracker();
tracker.startTracking();
tracker.addFrame(bottlePosition);
const metrics = tracker.getScanningMetrics();
```
